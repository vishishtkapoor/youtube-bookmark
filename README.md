# YouTube Timestamp Bookmarker Chrome Extension

The YouTube Timestamp Bookmarker is a handy Chrome extension that allows users to easily bookmark timestamps in YouTube videos. This extension is built using JavaScript and leverages the power of browser extensions to enhance your YouTube watching experience.

## Features

- **Timestamp Bookmarking:** While watching a YouTube video, you can click a button provided by the extension to bookmark the current timestamp. This is useful for saving and revisiting specific parts of the video later.

- **Custom Labeling:** Each bookmark can be labeled with a custom title to help you remember why you saved that particular timestamp.

- **List of Bookmarks:** The extension maintains a list of all the timestamps you've bookmarked for a video. You can view this list by clicking on the extension icon in the Chrome toolbar.

- **Direct Navigation:** Clicking on a bookmark in the list will instantly take you to the corresponding timestamp in the video.
